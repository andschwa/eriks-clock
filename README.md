University of Idaho's Arduino Monitored Pendulum Clock
======================================================

Code that comprises the monitoring software for a group of mechanical
engineers' senior project: a school-built mechanical pendulum clock.
This uses a photosensor to register interrupts caused by the swinging
of the pendulum, and compares its accuracy to that of the onboard clock.
I wasn't part of the group, I just wrote the code as a favor and to get
into the swing of all things Arduino. It works, but could be better.
